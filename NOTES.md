# Notes

## Local Environment

1) I had already installed Laravel Herd in Windows


## IDE - PhpStorm

For this assessment, I decided to use PhpStorm as my chosen IDE. The two main reasons are: 1) it appears to be a very
popular tool within the Php community with strong support, 2) I subscribe to Jetbrains Ultimate for personal use, so
it's available.

### Adapted Steps

1) For the `composer install` step, I clicked the button via the PhpStorm notification.
2) Ditto for the `npm install` step.
